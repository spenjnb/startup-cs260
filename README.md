# Startup-cs260
&emsp;My idea is creating an app that generates suggestions of things you can do during your free time. To personalize the experience users will take a quiz or have the option during the registration process to provide some information about themselves and the things they like to do. Users will be given options of activities to do with friends, alone, sports, recreational or for a date night. If the people you know are registered they can get updates and notifications of a new event or newly created party.<br/>&emsp;Customers can add pictures to keep and share memories. The app would provide links to places and calculate activities according to the suggested budget input by the users. The goal of the app if to get rid of the question most people face on a night out “where should we go?”.

<h3>Simon asssigment</h3>
&emsp;Implementing the different html files of Simon helped me apply the concepts that I learned from the HTML lectures and practices. I was able to use most of the material from the readings which I think is really important and very helpful.<br/>&emsp;I got to practice writing on Visual Studio and using the live server tool which helps me see live what is happening as I work on the webapp. Commiting and pushing the work to Github creates a good personal practice and habit that I am sure is necessary when working on complex and simple proyects.<br/>&emsp;Overall, it was a great way to practice which I really appreciate, I am sure this will be useful during the creation of my own original website.

<h3>Learning CSS</h3>
&emsp;Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) The tool that is used to give style to the bewsite.
<br/>
- There are different ways to associate HTML and CSS.<br/>
- CSS works in a cascade style. Lower level declarations override higher ones.<br/>
- It's defined as boxes. elements contents - padding - border - margin.<br/>
- Box-sizing value can be change to redifine the width and height to include padding and the border.<br/>
