# Startup-cs260
&emsp;My idea is creating an app that generates suggestions of things you can do during your free time. To personalize the experience users will take a quiz or have the option during the registration process to provide some information about themselves and the things they like to do. Users will be given options of activities to do with friends, alone, sports, recreational or for a date night. If the people you know are registered they can get updates and notifications of a new event or newly created party.<br/>&emsp;Customers can add pictures to keep and share memories. The app would provide links to places and calculate activities according to the suggested budget input by the users. The goal of the app if to get rid of the question most people face on a night out “where should we go?”.

<h3>Important</h3>
&emsp;Use the ssh console program to shell into your production environment server. <br/>
ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@[yourdomainnamehere] <br/>
Example: ssh -i ~/keys/production.pem ubuntu@myfunkychickens.click <br/>

<h3>Learning HTML</h3>
&emsp;Structure of webpage. Format for webpages o documents, uses elements and tags. It's got attributes and classes thta classify groups of elements. We can add images and links to other pages by using "href" hyperlink. <br/>

<h3>Startup JS</h3>
&emsp;It was a challenge at the beginning, because I had to organize my ideas between what I wanted to do and how to actually implement it. I was thinking in terms of code and it gave me a hard time. Then I decided to think about the functionality of the website and what I wanted it to do. This approach helped me visualize the code in my head better and I was able to start writing some javascript. I guess what I learned the most while working on this project was that it is good to have a good picture of the purpose of the app and start from there instead of trying to just write code. As I started working, all the reading assigments also started coming to my mind and I considered the importance of taking notes and remembering where to go to find more information about JavaScript and its tools. 
  
<h3>Simon asssignment</h3>
&emsp;Implementing the different html files of Simon helped me apply the concepts that I learned from the HTML lectures and practices. I was able to use most of the material from the readings which I think is really important and very helpful.<br/>&emsp;I got to practice writing on Visual Studio and using the live server tool which helps me see live what is happening as I work on the webapp. Commiting and pushing the work to Github creates a good personal practice and habit that I am sure is necessary when working on complex and simple proyects.<br/>&emsp;Overall, it was a great way to practice which I really appreciate, I am sure this will be useful during the creation of my own original website.
<br/>
<h3>Learning CSS</h3>
&emsp;Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) The tool that is used to give style to the bewsite.
<br/>
- There are different ways to associate HTML and CSS.<br/>
- CSS works in a cascade style. Lower level declarations override higher ones.<br/>
- It's defined as boxes. elements contents - padding - border - margin.<br/>
- Box-sizing value can be change to redifine the width and height to include padding and the border.<br/>

<h3>Simon Css Assignment</h3>
&emsp;Updating the previous HTML files and adding the css file was very interesting this week. I learned that rewriting html files when they were using outdated or old code can be dificult since things can fall apart very easy and one can sometimes get lost because of it. However, the structure of the html themselves was solid and I was able to see were things were moving and interpret what was happening to the webpage. So it important to have solid structures and trust things will come together after everything has been written.<br/>
&emsp;Bootstrap is very helpful, there are so many tools that make writing html easier and more intuitive. It words well with VS IDE, so having frameworks proves to ve very advantageous. It is important to keep track of the components and look them up online if necessary to make sure we are sure of what is happening.<br/>
- Naming classes appropiately helps understand css better. <br/>
- To see boder lines, use "border: size solid color. <br/>
- Take advantage of positioning by using, absolute/relative, flex, float. <br/>

<h3>Learning JavaScript</h3>
&emsp;Language based on C, Java, and Scheme. Most used language and all websites use them. It compiles at runtime. JavaScript does not complain too much (which is actually not good). Important links to refer to for more information [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Browser_support_for_JavaScript_APIs) or [CanIUse](https://caniuse.com/). JS is a weakly typed language, meaning that variables always have type, but they can change type when assigned a new value. <br/>
- JavaScript console object provides interaction wiht debuggers console. <br/>
- Console object outputs value of texts and objects, timers and iterations. <br/>
- Link : https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/javascript/console/console.md. <br/>
- To insert JavaScript to HTML file we can either put it in directly or use the src attribute and reference the JS file. <br/>
- To declare variables we will use either "let" if we want to be able to make changes to variable or "const" if we do not want to change it. <br/> <br/>

<h4>JavaScript defines several primitives types:</h4>

| Type        | Meaning                                                    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Null`      | The type of a variable that has not been assigned a value. |
| `Undefined` | The type of a variable that has not been defined.          |
| `Boolean`   | true or false.                                             |
| `Number`    | A 64 bit signed number.                                    |
| `BigInt`    | A number of arbitrary magnitude.                           |
| `String`    | A textual sequence of characters.                          |
| `Symbol`    | A unique value.                                            |

<h4>Some commonly used objects:</h4>

| Type       | Use                                                                                    | Example                  |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `Object`   | A collection of properties represented by name value pairs. Values can be of any type. | `{a:3, b:'fish'}`        |
| `Function` | An object that has the ability to be called.                                           | `function a() {}`        |
| `Date`     | Calendar dates and times.                                                              | `new Date('1995-12-17')` |
| `Array`    | An ordered sequence of any type.                                                       | `[3, 'fish']`            |
| `Map`      | A collection of key value pairs that support efficient lookups.                        | `new Map()`              |
| `JSON`     | A lightweight data-interchange format used to share information across programs.       | `{"a":3, "b":"fish"}`    |

<h5>Common Operators</h5>
- add '+' - subtract '-' - multiply '*'  divide '/'. <br/>
- Important difference between, Strict Equality '===' (three) and Equality '==' (two). <br/>
- JS supports concatenation. <br/>
- Ternary operator, compact 'if else', (if 'a' equals '1' ) a === 1 ? (print '1') console.log(1) (else) : (print 'not 1') console.log('not 1'); <br/>
<h4>Functions</h4>
- JS functions are first class objects, meaning they can be assigned a name, passed as a parameter, returned as a result and referenced from an object or array like any other variable. </br>
- Functions can be defiend anonymously and assigned to a variable. </br>
- Functions can be declared inside other fuctions. </br>
- To avoid cluttering due to lots of anonymous functions, JS has arrow syntax. "() => 3"; </br>
<h4>Arrays</h4>
Some functions associated with arrays in J:<br/><br/>

| Function | Meaning                                                   | Example                       |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| push     | Add an item to the end of the array                       | `a.push(4)`                   |
| pop      | Remove an item from the end of the array                  | `x = a.pop`                   |
| slice    | Return a sub-array                                        | `a.slice(1,-1)`               |
| sort     | Run a function sort an array in place                     | `a.sort((a,b) => b-a)`        |
| values   | Creates an iterator for use with a `for of` loop          | `for (i of a.values()) {...}` |
| find     | Find the first item satisfied by a test function          | `a.find(i => i < 2)`          |
| forEach  | Run a function on each array item                         | `a.forEach(console.log)`      |
| reduce   | Run a function to reduce each array item to a single item | `a.reduce((a, c) => a + c)`   |
| map      | Run a function to map an array to a new array             | `a.map(i => i+i)`             |
| filter   | Run a function to remove items                            | `a.filter(i => i%2)`          |
| every    | Run a function to test if all items match                 | `a.every(i => i < 3)`         |
| some     | Run a function to test if any items match                 | `a.some(i => 1 < 1)`          |

<h4>Objects and Classes</h4>
* Objects can be dynamically modify. <br/>
* We can use object-literal syntax to declare a variable of object type. <br/>
* Objects have static functions some of them are, 'entries', 'keys', 'values'. <br/>
* Any method that returns an object is considered a constructor. It can be invoked with `new` operator. <br/>
* Objects can have any type of property value. Methods can be created as part of the objects encapsulation. <br/>
* `this` pointer depends upon the scope of where it is used. It objects it refers to the to a pointer to the object. <br/>
<h4>Classes</h4>
* Classes can define objects. <br/>
* It helps clarify the intent to create a reusable component. <br/>
* Classes have explicit constructors. <br/>
* To make properties and functions private use prefix `#`. <br/>
* Classes can be extended using `extends` keyword to define inheritance. <br/>
* Parameters passed to the parent class are delivered using `super` function. <br/>
* Methods with same name as parent method override the parent's implementation. <br/>
* To access parent method we can use `super` keyword. <br/>
<h4>Regular Expressions (Regex)</h4>
&emsp;Regular expressions are patterns used to match combinations in strings. We can create regular expressions usings literal or objects.</br>
- Use literal if we know the pattern and if we are sure it won't change. </br>
- Constructor works better if we need to get pattern from user getting it from input. </br>
- More details in this link: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions">Regular Expressions</a> <br/>
<h4>Scope</h4>
1. Gobal - Visible to all code </br>
2. Module - Visible to all code running in a module </br>
3. Function - Visible within a function </br>
4. Block - Visible within a block of code delimited by curly braces </br>
Link for more details: <a href="https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/javascript/scope/scope.md">Scope</a> <br/>
<h4>Document Object Model</h4>
<h5>Event Listeners</h5>
All DOM elements support the ability to attach a function that gets called when an event occurs on the element.<br/>
These functions are called event listeners.<br/><br/>

| Event Category | Description           |
| -------------- | --------------------- |
| Clipboard      | Cut, copied, pasted   |
| Focus          | An element gets focus |
| Keyboard       | Keys are pressed      |
| Mouse          | Click events          |
| Text selection | When text is selected |

<br/>

<h4>URL</h4>
&emsp;The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) represents the location of a web resource. A web resource can be anything, such as a web page, font, image, video stream, database record, or JSON object. It can also be completely ephemeral, such as a visitation counter, or gaming session.<br/>

The URL syntax uses the following convention. Notice the delimiting punctuation between the parts of the URL. Most parts of the URL are optional. The only ones that are required are the scheme, and the domain name.

```yaml
<scheme>://<domain name>:<port>/<path>?<parameters>#<anchor>
```

| Part        | Example                              | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scheme      | https                                | The protocol required to ask for the resource. For web applications, this is usually HTTPS. But it could be any internet protocol such as FTP or MAILTO.                                                                                                                            |
| Domain name | byu.edu                              | The domain name that owns the resource represented by the URL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Port        | 3000                                 | The port specifies the numbered network port used to connect to the domain server. Lower number ports are reserved for common internet protocols, higher number ports can be used for any purpose. The default port is 80 if the scheme is HTTP, or 443 if the scheme is HTTPS.     |
| Path        | /school/byu/user/8014                | The path to the resource on the domain. The resource does not have to physically be located on the file system with this path. It can be a logical path representing endpoint parameters, a database table, or an object schema.                                                    |
| Parameters  | filter=names&highlight=intro,summary | The parameters represent a list of key value pairs. Usually it provides additional qualifiers on the resource represented by the path. This might be a filter on the returned resource or how to highlight the resource. The parameters are also sometimes called the query string. |
| Anchor      | summary                              | The anchor usually represents an sub-location in the resource. For HTML pages this represents a request for the browser to automatically scroll to the element with an ID that matches the anchor. The anchor is also sometimes called the hash, or fragment ID.                    |

Technically you can also provide a user name and password before the domain name. This was used historically to authenticate access, but for security reasons this is deprecated. However, you will still see this convention for URLs that represent database connection strings.

<br/>

<h4>Ports</h4>
&emsp;When you connect to a device on the internet you need both an IP address and a numbered port. Port numbers allow a single device to support multiple protocols (e.g. HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, or SSH) as well as different types of services (e.g. search, document, or authentication). The ports may be exposed externally, or they may only be used internally on the device. For example, the HTTPS port (443) might allow the world to connect, the SSH port (22) might only allow computers at your school, and a service defined port (say 3000) may only allow access to processes running on the device.<br/>
&emsp;The internet governing body, IANA, defines the standard usage for port numbers. Ports from 0 to 1023 represent standard protocols. Generally a web service should avoid these ports unless it is providing the protocol represented by the standard. Ports from 1024 to 49151 represent ports that have been assigned to requesting entities. However, it is very common for these ports to be used by services running internally on a device. Ports from 49152 to 65535 are considered dynamic and are used to create dynamic connections to a device. <br/>

Here is a list of common port numbers that you might come across.

| Port | Protocol                                                                                           |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 20   | File Transfer Protocol (FTP) for data transfer                                                     |
| 22   | Secure Shell (SSH) for connecting to remote devices                                                |
| 25   | Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) for sending email                                             |
| 53   | Domain Name System (DNS) for looking up IP addresses                                               |
| 80   | Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for web requests                                                |
| 110  | Post Office Protocol (POP3) for retrieving email                                                   |
| 123  | Network Time Protocol (NTP) for managing time                                                      |
| 161  | Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) for managing network devices such as routers or printers |
| 194  | Internet Relay Chat (IRC) for chatting                                                             |
| 443  | HTTP Secure (HTTPS) for secure web requests                                                        |

<br/>
It does not matter what high range port you use. It only matters that you are consistent and that they are only used by one service.
<br/>
<h4>HTTP</h4>
&emsp;HTTP is how the web talks. When a web browser makes a request to a web server it does it using the HTTP protocol. In previous instruction we discussed how to use HTTP. Now, we will talk about the internals of HTTP. Just like becoming fluent in a foreign language make a visit to another country more enjoyable, understanding how to speak HTTP helps you communicate effectively when talking on the web. When a web client (e.g. a web browser) and a web server talk they exchange HTTP requests and responses. The browser will make an HTTP request and the server will generate an HTTP response.<br/>

in your console you can use curl to make the following request.
<br/>

```sh
curl -v -s http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Helping.html
```

<h5>Verbs</h5>
There are several verbs that describe what the HTTP request is asking for. The list below only describes the most common ones.
<br/>

| Verb    | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET     | Get the requested resource. This can represent a request to get a single resource or a resource representing a list of resources.                                                                                                                        |
| POST    | Create a new resource. The body of the request contains the resource. The response should include a unique ID of the newly created resource.                                                                                                             |
| PUT     | Update a resource. Either the URL path, HTTP header, or body must contain the unique ID of the resource being updated. The body of the request should contain the updated resource. The body of the response may contain the resulting updated resource. |
| DELETE  | Delete a resource. Either the URL path or HTTP header must contain the unique ID of the resource to delete.                                                                                                                                              |
| OPTIONS | Get metadata about a resource. Usually only HTTP headers are returned. The resource itself is not returned.                                                                                                                                              |

<h5>Status codes</h5>
&emsp;It is important that you use the standard HTTP status codes in your HTTP responses so that the client of a request can know how to interpret the response. The codes are partitioned into five blocks. Here are some of the more common codes.<br/>

| Code | Text                                                                                 | Meaning                                                                                                                           |

<h5>Headers</h5>

&emsp;HTTP headers specify metadata about a request or response. This includes things like how to handle security, caching, data formats, and cookies. Some common headers that you will use include the following.<br/>

<h4>SOP and CORS</h4>
&emsp;Security should always be on your mind when you are working with the web. The ability to provide services to a global audience makes the information on the web very valuable, and therefore an attractive target for nefarious parties. When website architecture and browser clients were still in their infancy they allowed JavaScript to make requests from one domain while displaying a website from a different domain. These are called cross-origin requests.<br/>
&emsp;This provides significant security, but it also introduces complications when building web applications. For example, if you want build a service that any web application can use it would also violate the SOP and fail. In order to address this, the concept of Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) was invented.CORS allows the client (e.g. browser) to specify the origin of a request and then let the server respond with what origins are allowed.<br/>

<h4>Fetch</h4>
&emsp;The ability to make HTTP requests from JavaScript is one of the main technologies that changed the web from static content pages (Web 1.0) to one of web applications (Web 2.0) that fully interact with the user. Microsoft introduced the first API for making HTTP requests from JavaScript with the XMLHttpRequest API. The basic usage of fetch takes a URL and returns a promise. The promise then function takes a callback function that is asynchronously called when the requested URL content is obtained. If the returned content is of type application/json you can use the json function on the response object to convert it to a JavaScript object.

<h4>Service Design</h4>
&emsp;Here are some things you should consider when designing your service's endpoints.<br/>

Grammatical - With HTTP everything is a resource (think noun or object). You act on the resource with an HTTP verb. For example, you might have an order resource that is contained in a store resource. You then create, get, update, and delete order resources on the store resource.<br/>

Readable - The resource you are referencing with an HTTP request should be clearly readable in the URL path. For example, an order resource might contain the path to both the order and store where the order resource resides: /store/provo/order/28502. This makes it easier to remember how to use the endpoint because it is human readable.<br/>

Discoverable - As you expose resources that contain other resources you can provide the endpoints for the aggregated resources. This makes it so someone using your endpoints only needs to remember the top level endpoint and then they can discover everything else. For example, if you have a store endpoint that returns information about a store you can include an endpoint for working with a store in the response.<br/>

Compatible - When you build your endpoints you want to make it so that you can add new functionality without breaking existing clients. Usually this means that the clients of your service endpoints should ignore anything that they don't understand. Consider the two following JSON response versions.<br/>

If you are fortunate enough to be able to control all of your client code you can mark the name field as depreciated and in a future version remove it once all of the clients have upgraded. Usually you want to keep compatibility with at least one previous version of the endpoint so that there is enough time for all of the clients to migrate before compatibility is removed.<br/>

Simple - Keeping your endpoints focused on the primary resources of your application helps to avoid the temptation to add endpoints that duplicate or create parallel access to primary resources. It is very helpful to write some simple class and sequence diagrams that outline your primary resources before you begin coding. These resources should focus on the actual resources of the system you are modeling. They should not focus on the data structure or devices used to host the resources. There should only be one way to act on a resource. Endpoints should only do one thing.<br/>

Documented - The Open API Specification is a good example of tooling that helps create, use, and maintain documentation of your service endpoints. It is highly suggested that you make use of such tools in order to provide client libraries for your endpoints and a sandbox for experimentation. Creating an initial draft of your endpoint documentation before you begin coding will help you mentally clarify your design and produce a better final result. Providing access to your endpoint documentation along with your production system helps with client implementations and facilitates easier maintenance of the service. The Swagger Petstore example documentation is a reasonable example to follow.<br/>

<h3>Node.js</h5>
&emsp;In 2009 Ryan Dahl created Node.js. It was the first successful application for deploying JavaScript outside of a browser. This changed the JavaScript mindset from a browser technology to one that could run on the server as well. Browsers run JavaScript using a JavaScript interpreter and execution engine. For example, Chromium based browsers all use the V8 engine created by Google. Node.js simply took the V8 engine and ran it inside of a console application. When you run a JavaScript program in Chrome or Node.js, it is V8 that reads your code and executes it. With either program wrapping V8, the result is the same.<br/>

&emsp;While you could write all of the JavaScript for everything you need, it is always helpful to use preexisting packages of JavaScript for implementing common tasks. To load a package using Node.js you must take two steps. First install the package locally on your machine using the Node Package Manager (NPM), and then include a require statement in your code that references the package name. NPM is automatically installed when you installed Node.js.

NPM knows how to access a massive repository of preexisting packages. You can search for packages on the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">NPM website</a>. However, before you start using NPM to install packages you need to initialize you code to use NPM. This is done by creating a directory that will contain your JavaScript and then running npm init. NPM will step you through a series of questions about the project you are creating. You can press the return key for each of questions if you want to accept the defaults. If you are always going to accept all of the defaults you can use npm init -y and skip the Q&A.<br/>

```sh
➜  mkdir npmtest
➜  cd npmtest
➜  npm init -y
```
<h4>Package.json</h4>
&emsp;If you list the files in directory you will notice that it has created a file named `package.json`. This file contains three main things: 1) Metadata about your project such as its name and the default entry JavaScript file, 2) commands that you can execute to do things like run, test, or distribute your code, and 3) packages that this project depends upon. With NPM initialized to work with your project, you can now use it to install a node package.<br/>

1. Create your project directory
1. Initialize it for use with NPM by running `npm init -y`
1. Make sure `.gitignore` file contains `node-modules`
1. Install any desired packages with `npm install <package name here>`
1. Add `require('<package name here>')` to your JavaScript code
1. Run your code with `node main.js`

<h4>Creating a web service</h4>
With JavaScript we can write code that listens on a server port (e.g. 8080), receives HTTP requests, processes them, and then responds. We can use this to create a simple web service that we then execute using Node.js.

The following example first initializes the use of NPM and installs the package `http`. The http package contains the functionality for listening on server ports and manipulating HTTP requests.<br/>

```sh
➜ mkdir webservicetest
➜ cd webservicetest
➜ npm init -y
➜ npm install http
```
<h4>Express</h4>
&emsp;to build a production ready application you need a framework with a bit more functionality for easily implementing a full web service. This is where the Node package `Express` come in. Express provides support for:<br/>

1. Routing requests for service endpoints<br/>
2. Manipulating HTTP requests with JSON body content<br/>
3. Generating HTTP responses<br/>
4. Using `middleware` to add functionality<br/>

<h5>Defining Routes</h5>
&emsp;HTTP endpoints are implemented in Express by defining routes that call a function based upon an HTTP path. The Express app object supports all of the HTTP verbs as functions on the object. For example, if you want to have a route function that handles an HTTP GET request for the URL path `/store/provo` you would call the `get` method on the app.<br/><br/>

```js
app.get('/store/provo', (req, res, next) => {
  res.send({ name: 'provo' });
});
```
<br/>
The `get` function takes two parameters, a URL path matching pattern, and a callback function that is invoked when the pattern matches. The path matching parameter is used to match against the URL path of an incoming HTTP request.

The callback function has three parameters that represent the HTTP request object (`req`), the HTTP response object (`res`), and the `next` routing function that Express expects to be called if this routing function wants another function to generate a response.

The express app compares the routing function patterns in the order that they are added to the Express app object. So if you have two routing functions with patterns that both match, the first one that was added will be called and given the next matching function in the `next` parameter.

In our example above we hard coded the store name to be `provo`. A real store endpoint would allow any store name to be provided as a parameter in the path. Express supports path parameters by prefixing the parameter name with a colon (`:`). Express creates a map of path parameters and populates it with the matching values found in the URL path. You then reference the parameters using the `req.params` object. Using this pattern you can rewrite our getStore endpoint as follows.

```js
app.get('/store/:storeName', (req, res, next) => {
  res.send({ name: req.params.storeName });
});
```

If we run our JavaScript using node we can see the result when make an HTTP request using curl.

```sh
➜ curl localhost:8080/store/orem
{"name":"orem"}
```

If you wanted an endpoint that used the POST or DELETE HTTP verb then you just use the `post` or `delete` function on the Express app object.

The route path can also include a limited wildcard syntax or even full regular expressions in path pattern. Here are a couple route functions using different pattern syntax.

```js
// Wildcard - matches /store/x and /star/y
app.put('/st*/:storeName', (req, res) => res.send({ update: req.params.storeName }));

// Pure regular expression
app.delete(/\/store\/(.+)/, (req, res) => res.send({ delete: req.params[0] }));
```

Notice that in these examples the `next` parameter was omitted. Since we are not calling `next` we do not need to include it as a parameter. However, if you do not call next then no following middleware functions will be invoked for the request.

<h4>Puttung it all together</h5>
Here is a full example of our web service built using Express.

```js
const express = require('express');
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
const app = express();

<h4>PM2</h4>
&emsp;When you run a program from the console the program will automatically terminate when you close the console or if the computer restarts. In order to keep programs running after a shutdown you need to register it as a `daemon`. The term daemon comes from the idea of something that is always there working in the background. Hopefully you only have good daemons running in your background.<br/>

&emsp;We want our web services to continue running as a daemon. We would also like a easy way to start and stop our services. That is what [Process Manager 2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/) (PM2) does.<br/>

&emsp;PM2 is already installed on your production server as part of the AWS AMI that you selected when you launched your server. Additionally, the deployment scripts found with the Simon projects automatically modify PM2 to register and restart your web services. That means you should not need to do anything with PM2. However, if you run into problems such as your services are not running, then here are some commands that you might find useful.<br/>

&emsp;You can SSH into your server and see PM2 in action by running the following command.<br/>

```sh
pm2 ls
```
